                            feeling frustrated, it can help sometimes to take a
                            break and blow out your imaginary candle before
                            trying to do something. When you’re feeling
                            frustrated, take a breath before you try again (like
                            when their block tower fell over), take monster
                            meditation belly breaths, so they can build the tower
                            again.</div>
